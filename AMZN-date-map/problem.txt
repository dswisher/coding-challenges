How would you design a class that behaves similar to a
Java Map <Date,Object> except that get() returns the mapped value for
not only an exact match but also for the latest Date in the Map up to
(but not including) the requested Date? Note that null is returned for
get() if a Date earlier than the earliest date in the Map.

Implement the get() and put() methods of the class. What are good test
cases for these two methods?

(return previous closest date, if any)
