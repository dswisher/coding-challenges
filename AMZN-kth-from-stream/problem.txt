Imagine you have a stream of numbers coming from some system and
you want to store them. Design a data structure to store these
numbers. Given a number in the structure, tell the ranking of the
number in the natural order of the value.

Example: for a list of numbers 1, 2, 6, 5, 7, when given the
number 5, return 3 as 5 ranks the 3rd smallest number.
